1. Getting Started:
...*Why- This is Berkeley Coding Boot Camp (BCBC) week 4 homework assignment. The BCBC curriculum generally focuses on JavaScript along with HTML/CSS, using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) software stack, to teach web development skills across HTML/CSS/Javascript. 

...*What- This homework covers the following aspects of web development on the client side to build a [train scheduling web-based application](assets/images/trainscheduler.png): realtime database, jQuery, Moment.js, Bootstrap.

...*Objective- When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following: Train Name, Destination, First Train Time -- in military time, Frequency -- in minutes. Calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time. Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

...*How- TBD
